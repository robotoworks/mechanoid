Getting Started
===============
If you are familiar with the Android SDK then getting up and running with
Mechanoid should be quite straight forward.

This topic will guide you through the process of installing Mechanoid and
setting it up for an Android Project.

Prerequisites
-------------
The following points outline the requirements of Mechanoid.

* The plugin is developed and tested with Eclipse Juno and has not been tested with previous versions.
* The Mechanoid generated source code requires the Mechanoid Library Jar which is compatible with Android API Level 8 and upwards.
* The Mechanoid generated source requires the Android SDK and is only known to work with Android Projects and Android Library Projects.

Installation
------------
Mechanoid can be installed like other Eclipse Plugins. In Eclipse go to Help > 
Install New Software and add the following update site URL.

**Latest Snapshot (0.2.0)**: ``http://www.robotoworks.com/mechanoid/updates/snapshot``

Android Project Setup
---------------------
The following steps describe how to setup a project for Mechanoid:

.. rubric:: Step 1: Create Android Project

Create an Android Project with the Eclipse ADT Plugin

.. rubric:: Step 2: Put Mechanoid Runtime Library In Your Classpath

Copy the mechanoid.jar library to the libs folder of your Android project

**Latest Snapshot (0.2.0)**: ``http://www.robotoworks.com/mechanoid/updates/snapshot/mechanoid.jar``

**Latest Snapshot (0.2.0) (Source, Docs)**: ``http://www.robotoworks.com/mechanoid/updates/snapshot/mechanoid-sources.jar``

.. note:: If you have not added the library, Eclipse will show an error and provide a quickfix to add it, this provides the best compatibility because the library is bundled with the plugin

.. warning:: 
   The Mechanoid Plugin requires the Mechanoid library (mechanoid.jar), if it 
   is not present or up-to-date compilation errors can occur if the generated 
   Mechanoid source code references classes/methods that do not exist in the 
   mechanoid.jar. Always make sure you have the latest version of the library â€“ 
   when updating the plugin also update mechanoid library in your projects.

.. rubric:: Step 3: Initialize Mechanoid in your Application

For mechanoid to work it needs to be initialized, you do this by adding calling 
:java:extdoc:`Mechanoid.init(Context) <com.robotoworks.mechanoid.Mechanoid.init(android.content.Context)>` 
in a custom application class as follows:

.. code-block:: java

	public class MyApplication extends Application {
	 
	    @Override
	    public void onCreate() {
	        super.onCreate();
	 
	        Mechanoid.init(this);
	    }
	}

Then make sure your application class is registered in your manifest:

.. code-block:: xml

	<application android:name="MyApplication">
   
   
Upgrading
---------
Once you have installed the Mechanoid Plugin, you can check to see if updates
are available in Eclipse by going to ``Help > Check for Updates``.

After upgrading it is possible that new code is generated that relies on an
updated Mechanoid Library (mechanoid.jar), if the library is out of date, then
compile errors will be introduced since the new generated source could reference
new features of the library.

To update the library, you can simply delete the Mechanoid Library jar's from your 
``/libs`` folder, after doing so, your Mechanoid files will show an error
offering a quickfix to add the Mechanoid Libraries, as in the screenshot below:
