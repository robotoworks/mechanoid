Introduction
============
Mechanoid is an Eclipse Plugin sporting a set of code generators for Androidâ„¢ 
driven by DSL's (Domain Specific Languages) with full Eclipse Editor Support 
for the rapid development of Android applications.

Mechanoid is currently composed of four generators, each code generator focuses
on specific components of an Android application.

Each code generator comes with first class Eclipse editor support including
syntax highlighting, content assist and validation thanks to the powerful 
xText Language Framwork.

The following sections briefly describe the purpose of each generator.

.. container:: row-fluid

   .. container:: span5 offset1
   
      .. rubric:: |mechdb|
      
      |mechdb| is a code generator driven by the Sqlite grammar itself, with some
      extra constructs to define schema migrations, |mechdb| generates a
      Content Provider API from directly from sql creational statements such 
      as **create table** and **create view**.

   .. container:: span5

      .. rubric:: |mechnet|
      
      |mechnet| is a simple DSL to define JSON over REST clients. |mechnet| will
      generate a REST Client API, entities, and entity serializers/deserializers from 
      your definition.

.. container:: row-fluid

   .. container:: span5 offset1
   
      .. rubric:: |mechops|
      
      |mechops| is a DSL to define decoupled background operations, which are useful
      when making network requests or long running tasks from activities and
      fragments, |mechops| is designed around the pattern described by 
      Virgil Dobjanschi in the Google IO 2010 REST Presentation.

   .. container:: span5

      .. rubric:: |mechnet|
      
      |mechprefs| is possibly the simplest DSL in the set, it allows you to
      define and generate Shared Preference wrappers that make preferences
      easier to work with in code.
